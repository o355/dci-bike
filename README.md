# DCI Electric Bike - Socket Server/Client
This branch has the node js side of things meaning the socket server and also the client side.

# Why Socket Server
We will use a socket server because we can constantly monitor them and also we can collect data just by connecting to each individual bike from the Socket server.

# Why Node JS
This branch is node JavaScript because socket servers are somewhat easier to make in node js because we have a platform to base it on https://www.npmjs.com/
